### How I approached solving each problem

##### Problem 1 - [Multiples of 3 or 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)

What I tried:
- review the problem
```
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```
- use `for` loops
- include division with the modulus operator `%` to show remainders
- Look at the problem again
- use `if` and `or` statement to find all values with `0` remainder them `sum`
- solve the problem
